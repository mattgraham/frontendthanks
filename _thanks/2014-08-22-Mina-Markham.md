I first met Dan and Cherrie when I attended Front End Design Conference in 2011. I was new to the tech community and wasn't sure if I belonged there. That feeling lasted for about an hour. I met some of the best, warmest people I know that weekend, many of whom I still consider friends. I only wish I had heard about it sooner.

It was that warmth and love that compelled me to submit a talk for 2013. I'd never spoken in public before, but Dan, for God knows what reason, decided to give me a chance. And that chance has changed the trajectory of my life. 

This past year, I've had the opporunity to [speak](http://www.midwest.io/) [at](https://distill.engineyard.com/) [several](https://www.thatconference.com/) [conferences](http://frontporch.io/), chat with a [couple of my web heroes](http://shoptalkshow.com/) and [mentor women in public speaking](http://passion-projects.is/). But I wouldn't have had the confidence to do any of it without the encouragement and gentle push from Dan. For that, I'm forever grateful.

Plus, Cherrie introduced me to the awesomeness of bacon-themed desserts. That alone deserves a standing ovation.

Dan and Cherrie created something special. It was more than a conference. It was a family. It was home. And there will never be another place like it.

Thank you <3
