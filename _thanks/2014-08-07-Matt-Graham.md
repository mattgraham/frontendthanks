I've traveled around the globe to different conferences (Lion France, Racife Brazil, Honolulu, etc). and I have seen some amazing geographical locations to host the most incredible events in our industry; but I've never had a team of people welcome me into anyone of those events like Dan and Cherrie have. Anyone who has ever attended Front-End conf in St. Petersburg, Florida knows this kind of welcoming. My quick three thoughts:

## Industry Friends
Dan and I had met previously in St. Petersburg while I was vacationing and after a few drinks and pizza I knew I didn't want to miss the event. It was like a bromance in its early stages. Since, so many of the friendships I've made via frontend have proven to be the most 'twittered' relationships that I have. Across the globe and country Front-End started that.

## On Stage
Dan asked me to speak in 2012, however, I was way to nervous for that. Instead I talked GitHub into sponsoring the party and enjoyed my first Front-End event as a spectator. In 2013 he asked me back; and I couldn't say no. My first full length stage debut, [Front-End 2013](https://madebygraham.com/2013/10/28/Speaking-Out.html). A memory I'll have forever.

## Final Thank You
Dan and Cherrie have birthed (sorry for that visual) an event like no other. From chocolate covered bacon to late night karaoke we'll all miss the event itself, but thankfully due to the hard work they've put in, we're now able to build on these memories forever. Thank you guys.
