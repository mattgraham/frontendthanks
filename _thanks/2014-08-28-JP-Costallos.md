Being fresh into the web field and still in college there were times when I felt discouraged and intimidated when talking with others in the industry, I definitely experienced impostor syndrome as [@elyseholladay](https://twitter.com/elyseholladay) mentioned in her talk this year.

But when I met Dan at Design Orlando he was so excited to see young students like myself wanting to get involved in the field and the community. He continued to show this excitement and support as Front-End Conference approached by reaching out all the students at UCF wanting to participate. Dan always ensured that nobody ever felt alienated or lost and truly wanted to instill his love the the web and its community in others. 

Cherry and Dan, Thank you for teaching me to be as passionate about my work and community as you are!
